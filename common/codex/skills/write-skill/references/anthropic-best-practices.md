# Anthropic Prompt Best Practices (Condensed)

Use these principles when authoring SKILL.md or any prompt-like guidance:

- Be explicit and direct about desired outputs and constraints.
- Add relevant context (audience, purpose, success criteria) so the model can align behavior.
- Provide concrete examples that demonstrate the target behavior.
- Specify output format clearly when structure matters.
- Prefer telling the model what to do over what not to do.
- When uncertainty is possible, instruct the model to ask questions rather than guess.
